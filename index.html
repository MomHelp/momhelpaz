    <h2>What is MomHelp™</h2>
    <p>We all need a little help sometimes, and most moms are doing it all on their own. MomHelp™ was created to bring back that village feeling — in a modern, local way.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a cleaning service or childcare. It’s real-life help from one mom to another. Each visit is personalized to what your home and family truly need — whether that’s tidying, errands, laundry, or getting life back in order after a long week.</p>
