  <h2>About MomHelp™</h2>
  <p>MomHelp™ was created to bring back the feeling of having a village — the kind of support that once came naturally when families helped each other through the chaos of everyday life.</p>
  <p>We know what it’s like to juggle work, family, and home while trying to keep your space peaceful. That’s why MomHelp™ offers practical, judgment-free help — tidying, errands, and organizing that fit real life.</p>
  <p>Our mission is simple: to give moms a break, restore calm, and make home feel good again.</p>
